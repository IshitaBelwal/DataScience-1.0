# DataScience-1.0
First move towards Data Science,
a simple repository to learn basic Python libraries.

## [NumPy (Numerical Python)](https://numpy.org/)
**"import numpy as np"**

It is a python library consisting of multidimensional array objects and
a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, 
mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. 

Since python is a procedural language rather than a compiled language 
the speed during mathematical and logical operations on arrays is generally 
slow. To speed up the process NumPy is used as it is a faster option because 
its code is written in C, which is a compiled language and moreover it also
uses relatively less memory to store data.


## [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) 
**"import pandas as pd"**

It is a open source data analysis library written in python.
It leverages the power and speed of numpy to make data analysis and
preprocessing easy for data scientists. It provides rich and highly robust 
data operations.


## [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
**"import matplotlib.pyplot as plt"**

Matplotlib is a  cross-platform, data visualization and graphical plotting
library built on NumPy arrays, and designed to work with the broader 
SciPy stack. It offers a viable open source alternative to MATLAB.
Developers can also use matplotlib's APIs (Application Programming
Interfaces) to embed plots in GUI applications.


## [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/)
**"from scipy import *subpackage* "**

SciPy is a free and open-source Python library built on numpy used for
scientific computing and technical computing. SciPy contains modules for 
optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions,
FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common
in science and engineering.

## [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
**"import seaborn as sns"**

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. 
It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative 
statistical graphics.

## [Scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
**"from sklearn import *subpackage* "**

Scikit-learn (sklearn) is a free software machine learning library for the 
Python programming language. It features various classification, regression 
and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, 
gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with 
the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
